# Matching Pursuit Algorithm for Sparse Signal Decomposition 
This [repository](https://github.com/Hadian1989/matching_pursuit) contains an implementation of the Matching Pursuit (MP) algorithm in MATLAB. The MP algorithm is a technique used for sparse signal decomposition, where a signal is iteratively decomposed into a sparse representation using a dictionary of basis functions.

## Overview
The provided MATLAB scripts replicate the animation of the Matching Pursuit algorithm, similar to the illustration found on the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_pursuit
This implementation was developed as part of a university project for the Signal and Control course, FH-Dortmund. 
The repository includes:

- Initialization of Signals: Setting up the original signal, measurement matrix, and Hermite polynomial basis.
- Matching Pursuit Algorithm: Iteratively selecting the best matching basis functions and updating the signal approximation.
- Animation: Visualizing the iterative decomposition process to demonstrate how the algorithm approximates the signal.
  
Feel free to explore the scripts and animations to understand the application of the Matching Pursuit algorithm in signal processing.
